Investigate-a-Dataset
Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree December 2017 - May 2018 Project 3 - Exploring Gapminder Datasets using Python and Jupyter Notebook Click to preview

Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

What do I need to install?
I will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
csv
What will I learn?
After completing the project, I will:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
Project details
Step One - Choose the data
I chose four datasets from Gapminder.

Female salaried employee
Female literacy rate
Gdp per capita
Life expectancy at birth
Step two - Get Organized
Create a single folder (repositories) that contains:

The report communicating your findings
Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis
The data set you used
Step three - Analyse the data
Make questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. I aimed to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in my investigation. Make sure I use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

Step four - Share your findings
Create a report that shares the findings I found most interesting.
